**pnpm / tooling:**
- `typescript` must stay a **direct devDependency**. pnpm doesn't hoist it from Nuxt's deps, and
  `@nuxt/eslint-config` silently disables TS parsing without it — every TS file then fails lint
  with "Parsing error: Unexpected token". Same reason `tailwindcss` is pinned directly, and
  `vue-tsc` too — without it `nuxt typecheck` spawns `npx` (not on PATH here) and dies with ENOENT.
- pnpm 11 fails **any** script (even `pnpm lint`) if a dep has an unapproved build script. Fix:
  in `pnpm-workspace.yaml` `allowBuilds`, flip the auto-added placeholder to `true`/`false`,
  re-run `pnpm install`.
- Node here is pnpm-managed (`pnpm env`) → **no npm/npx by default**; anything spawning `npx`
  (plugin MCP servers like context7, `nuxt typecheck` without direct `vue-tsc`) dies with
  ENOENT / "Failed to connect". Fixed once via `pnpm add -g npm`; if an MCP server won't
  connect, check `which npx` before debugging the server.

**Claude Code / plugins:**
- Plugin-bundled MCP tools are named `mcp__plugin_<plugin>_<server>__<tool>`
  (e.g. `mcp__plugin_context7_context7__get-library-docs`), not bare `mcp__<server>__…`.
  A wrong name in an agent's `tools:` fails **silently** — the agent just lacks the tool.
- Agent types (.claude/agents) and MCP tool registration load at **session start** — a new
  agent file or newly connected server needs a restart before it's usable/spawnable.

**Nuxt routing / transitions:**
- `pageTransition` in `definePageMeta` leaks into the ROOT NuxtPage's `route.meta` and **remounts
  the whole page tree**. For a nested NuxtPage, use the `:transition` prop, not meta.
- **Never use nested route pages for the settings drawer**: the host page
  remounts on first child navigation (Vue Suspense/NuxtPage internals, never fully pinned;
  nuxt#13094). That's why settings is one route `/settings/:panel?` reusing the home page file with
  `key: 'home'`, and `SettingsDrawer` lives in the **layout**, not a page.
- Navbar content must stay **fixed per page instance** (params captured once in setup, no
  route-driven computeds) — the route changes before the leave-slide finishes, so live values swap
  content on the leaving page mid-animation.
- A page whose root component teleports (UDrawer) needs a real element root or navigation breaks.

**Nuxt UI / vaul:**
- Theme **compound variants** apply after `app.config.ts` slot classes and win in tailwind-merge —
  override via a matching `compoundVariants` entry in app.config, not slot classes.
- vaul emits `animationEnd(false)` once for its initial *closed* state after mount.
- vaul's `should-scale-background` mutates `<body>` inline styles — see
  [[feedback-no-global-visual-side-effects]].
